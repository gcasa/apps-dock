# DockWM

DockWM is a small GNUstep/AppKit dock-style window manager shell inspired by
WindowMaker.

It supports two inputs:

- Dropping application bundles or executable paths from GNUstep tools such as
  apps-gworkspace onto the dock.
- Discovering small X11 top-level windows, including common WindowMaker
  dockapps, and reparenting them into an X11 dock host.

## Build

```sh
make
```

## Run

```sh
./DockWM.app/DockWM
```

The AppKit dock accepts filesystem drops. A companion X11 override-redirect host
window is created next to it for dockapps and other small X11 clients.

Pinned applications that are moved or removed leave a question-mark placeholder
in their saved position by default. The tooltip identifies the missing app, and
its launch arguments and behavior settings are retained. The Dock checks for
changes every 15 seconds and restores the icon if the original path becomes
available again.

Disable **Keep placeholders for missing applications** in **Settings → Behavior**
to remove missing entries instead.

The missing-application regression checks can be run with:

```sh
sh Tests/run-missing-applications.sh
```

These checks require `clang`, GNUstep, and `xvfb-run`.
